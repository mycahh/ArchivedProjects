                <h1>The Wired</h1>
                <p>The Wired is a virtual world that controls and commands all forms of human communication, ranging from televisions and telephones to the internet and cyberspace. It is a metamorphosis of the virtual into the real, where there is little difference between what is real and what is virtual, or what has been acquired and what has been programmed.</p>
                <p>The Wired is accessed through a Navi, which is a device similar to a computer. Within the Wired, users can share their thoughts, have conversations, play games, and socialize. It is a world where identity is relative and the need for "masks" is nonexistent.</p>

                    <p>The Wired is a network that connects everything. It's like a consciousness, a collective unconscious. It's where everything is stored and where everything is connected. It's the past, the present, and the future all at once.</p>

                Plato believed that the intangible world is more real than the sensitive world because it is the world of Forms, or perfect and unchanging ideals. The sensible world, on the other hand, is a world of appearances, or copies of the Forms. Plato argued that the sensible world is constantly changing and imperfect, while the world of Forms is eternal and perfect.

                Nietzsche disagreed with Plato about dualism for a number of reasons. First, he believed that dualism is a sign of weakness and decadence. He argued that people who believe in dualism are trying to escape from the physical world and human life, which they see as flawed and imperfect. Nietzsche, on the other hand, embraced the physical world and human life, and he believed that we should strive to live our lives to the fullest.

                Plato's ideals have had a profound influence on philosophy history in a number of ways.
                  <ul>
                    <li>First, Plato's theory of Forms has been debated and discussed by philosophers for centuries. It is one of the most important and influential theories in philosophy, and it has shaped the way that philosophers think about the world, knowledge, and morality.
                      Second, Plato's emphasis on reason and rationality has been highly influential in Western philosophy. He was one of the first philosophers to argue that reason is the best way to understand the world and to live a good life.
